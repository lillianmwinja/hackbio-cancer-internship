**Differential Expression; Downregulation and Upregulation**

Gene expression involves deriving information from a gene to make a gene product, proteins for example (Anjum et al., 2016). Differential expression is considered to have occurred if there is an observable difference or alteration in levels of expression or read counts between two experimental conditions that is of statistical significance <a id="_Hlk176373100"></a>. Downregulation refers to a decrease in gene expression levels while upregulation refers to an increase in gene expression (Downregulation and Upregulation - Knowledge and References | Taylor & Francis, 2021).

Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis is a technique used to identify differentially expressed genes across multiple sample sets (Rosati et al., 2024). The results from this analysis can provide insight into how diseases are caused and help identify targets for new therapies at a molecular level. They are also utilised for identifying biomarkers<a id="_Hlk176373898"></a>These biomarkers are further used in diagnosis, treatment evaluation or prognosis.

There is evidence of down regulation playing a role in cancer. In a study conducted to observe how cells transform from normal to malignant, high numbers of downregulated genes among those that were differentially expressed. This showed a link between dedifferentiation and malignancy. Additionally, according to Rivas et al., 2012, downregulating the tumor-suppressor miR-16 through progestin-mediated oncogenic signalling contributed to the development of breast cancer. Futhermore, evidence of NDRG2 being downregulated has been exhibited in several human cancers (Guy-Joseph Lemamy, 2019).

 Upregulation of genes can also play a role in cancer progression. A good example is how upregulating  TET1 upregulation is known to drive growth of cancer cells via aberrant enhancer hydroxymethylation of HMGA2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (Shirai et al., 2021). An instance of both down regulation and upregulation at play is the downregulation of tumor suppresor genes and upregulation of oncogenes causing changes in calcium ion signalling, an indicator of cancer cells (Bittremieux et al., 2016)
